abstract: 'This workshop demonstrates how to leverage public multi-omics databases, such as the cBioPortal and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Workshop participants are given an overview of the `cBioPortalData`, `curatedTCGAData`, and `terraTCGAdata` (experimental) data packages. It introduces users to minimal data management with `MultiAssayExperiment` and `TCGAutils`, packages that organize and manage multi-omics datasets. The workshop will provide participants with ways to improve the ease-of-use of TCGA data, and introduce them to common Bioconductor data classes including `SummarizedExperiment`, `MultiAssayExperiment`, and `RaggedExperiment`. The workshop will also demonstrate the experimental `terraTCGAdata` package for working with TCGA data on the AnVIL Terra platform, as well as, a review of updates to existing functionality in `cBioPortalData`, `MultiAssayExperiment`, and `TCGAutils`.
