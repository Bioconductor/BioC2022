abstract: "Dynamic gene expression of multiple cell types in the endometrium is necessary for the remodeling, shedding, and regeneration of human endometrial tissue during the menstrual cycle. Identification of the key regulatory genes of different cell types at different menstrual phases would expand our understanding of endometrial homeostasis and ultimately lead to the treatment discovery for various infertility diseases. At the same time, fast profiling of the endometrial cell population from biopsy would also be crucial for the efficient diagnosis of infertility diseases. To this end, we proposed a classification deep learning model with explainability to predict cell type and menstrual phase from single-cell RNA sequencing profiles and also to identify important genes that contribute most to the prediction. We implement an additive attention algorithm namely fastformer that enables the model to learn from up to 60,000 input tokens, individual genes in this case, and assign the attention weight to all tokens without having to spend excessive memory on dot product attention. The model was trained on single-cell RNA sequencing data GSE111976 with a total of 70,545 cells and 7 types of cells: stromal fibroblasts, glandular epithelia, luminal epithelia, lymphocytes, ciliated epithelia, endothelia, and smooth muscle cells. There were 5 endometrial phases collected from a total of 10 subjects: proliferative (2), early secretory (3), early-mid secretory (3), mid secretory (1), and late secretory (1). To investigate the overall characteristics of the important gene sets, we performed gene ontology enrichment analysis to summarize the following features from the annotated Gene ontology (GO) terms: molecular functions, cellular component/compartment, and biological process. Gene names or aliases were converted to HGNC symbols using “limma” Bioconductor package. GO terms annotations and EntrezID were identified by matching HGNC symbols using “org.Hs.eg.db” package. As one gene may correspond to multiple GO terms, top gene ontology terms and enrichment analysis of the whole gene sets was analyzed by ‘limma’ package. Lastly, pathway analysis were conducted using both enrichment method and topology-based algorithm using ReactomePA and PathNet packages respectively."
