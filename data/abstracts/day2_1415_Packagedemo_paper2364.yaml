abstract: ["Spatial localization of gene expression and histological images in spatial transcriptomics present many opportunities unavailable to non-spatial single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). Some existing data analysis packages for spatial transcriptomics have been inspired by spatial statistics originally developed for geospatial data, such as Moran's I, Ripley's K, and Gaussian process regression. However, as existing tools generally regard cells or Visium spots as points and non-spatial methods are still widely used, many such opportunities have been missed. Here we present the SpatialFeatureExperiment (SFE) package, which implements an S4 class extending SpatialExperiment (SPE), to better take advantage of such opportunities. SF is a popular and well-established geospatial package that provides an R interface to the standard Simple Features representation of geometries and the GEOS C++ library for geometry operations. SFE brings sf to SPE, representing geometries associated with columns of the gene count matrix such as nuclei and cell segmentation and Visium spot polygons as sf data frames. Annotations such as tissue boundaries and histological regions, and annotated objects not corresponding to the columns such as nuclei segmentation in a Visium dataset, can also be stored in the SFE object as sf data frames. With sf, fast geometry operations can be applied, such as to find the number of nuclei in each Visium spot and which histological region each Visium spot intersects. In addition, spatial neighborhood graphs of cells/spots and of other annotated objects can be stored in the SFE object, to be used with classical geospatial tools, such as spatial dependence analyses with the spdep package and multivariate spatial analyses with the adespatial package. We demonstrate the opportunities presented by geospatial tools in an analysis of a Visium mouse skeletal muscle regeneration dataset using SFE. We performed spatial autocorrelation, hot spot analyses, and geographically weighted principal component analysis (GWPCA) of myofiber and nuclei morphology and identified histological regions based on these analyses. Spatial autocorrelation of canonical scRNA-seq quality control (QC) metrics such as library size and number of genes detected per spot is also examined. In addition, we relate the morphology and number of nuclei and myofibers in each Visium spot to gene expression. We plan to submit the SpatialFeatureExperiment to Bioconductor; the development version can be accessed on GitHub: https://github.com/pachterlab/SpatialFeatureExperiment.", "One of the most essential steps in single-cell sequencing analysis is the classification of cell clusters. The identification of cluster identities is essential to set up downstream analyses (e.g. differential gene expression, trajectory inference), which directly affects data interpretation. As single-cell sequencing becomes increasingly popular, there is a growing need for efficient, reproducible, and user-friendly methods to classify cell clusters. Current cell cluster classification methods include the mapping workflow used by Seurat (Hao et al. 2021), machine learning (ML) algorithms (Alquicira-Hernandez et al. 2019; Pliner et al. 2019), and identification of differentially expressed genes per cluster; however, the mapping workflow disrupts the original dimension reduction topology and confounds data interpretation. ML methods require large training datasets and need extensive computational proficiency. Lastly, manual interpretation of differential cluster expression is often time-intensive, not reproducible, and requires extensive prior biological knowledge. The nontrivial effort needed to classify cell clusters is relevant to both single and multi-omic sequencing assays such as CITE-Seq (cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing), which measures both RNA and surface protein markers (Stoeckius et al. 2017). To facilitate the classification of cell cluster identity in CITE-Seq data, we developed CITE-Viz which replicates a familiar and intuitive the flow cytometry gating workflow. In real time, users can iteratively subset cell populations of interest using the surface proteins and see those cells reflected in dimension reduction space (PCA, tSNE, UMAP, etc.). Conversely, users can highlight cells in dimension reduction space and quickly locate them in a gate window. Furthermore, CITE-Viz provides a basic quality control page for users to quickly assess the integrity of CITE-Seq datasets. In conclusion, CITE-Viz is an interactive tool that mimics the flow cytometry gating process to facilitate cell cluster classification in CITE-Seq data."]
