abstract: "The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is used to provide portable and reproducible data analysis workflows across different tools and computing environments. We have developed Rcwl, an R interface to CWL, to provide easier development, use and maintenance of CWL pipelines from within R. We have also collected nearly 200 pre-built tools and pipelines in RcwlPipelines, ready to be queried and used by researchers in their own analysis. A single-cell RNA-seq pre-processing pipeline demonstrates use of the software. "
