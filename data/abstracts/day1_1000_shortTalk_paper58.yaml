abstract: "As single cell transcriptome technology advances and aims to capture more and more cells, the question becomes which GEMs have quality cells in them and which algorithms and approaches are best for particular cells of interest. In this short talk I will go over Bioconductor and third party approaches to answer this question so that on your next analysis you won't be leaving data on the table."
