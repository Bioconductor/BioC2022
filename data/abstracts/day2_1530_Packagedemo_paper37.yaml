abstract: "Azure virtual machine (VM) extensions are small applications that provide post-deployment configuration and automation tasks on Azure VMs. For example, if a virtual machine requires software installation, antivirus protection, or the ability to run a script inside it, you can use a VM extension. [1] Users can run Azure VM extensions by using the Azure CLI, PowerShell, Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates), and the Azure portal. You can bundle extensions with a new VM deployment or run them against any existing system. [2] In this short workshop, we will provide an overview of Azure VM extensions using Bioconductorâ€™s system dependency shell file. We also discuss prerequisites for using them, and guidance on how to detect, manage, and remove them. This article provides generalized information because many VM extensions are available. Once deployment is completed with the prepared code for this conference: users will have a Linux Data Science VM which has the following features: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview. We will use built-in RStudio and Jupyter notebook features with latest Bioconductor applications on this 'short workshop'. In conclusion, these kinds of custom deployment options will provide flexibility to the researchers who would like to use cloud technologies. They do not need to keep the VMs, just deploy new resources once needed.   "
