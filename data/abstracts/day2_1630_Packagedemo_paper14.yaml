abstract: 'The Bioconductor teaching committee has produced three sets of training materials using the Carpentries pedagogical methods: 1) Introduction to data analysis with R and Bioconductor, 2) The Bioconductor project and 3) RNA-seq analysis with Bioconductor. These are freely available for anyone who wants to use all or part of them in their own teaching. This workshop will cover best practices for using the materials, suggestions on how to set up and run a workshop using Carpentries guiding principles, and how to contribute changes and improvements to the existing lessons.
