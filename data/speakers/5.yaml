text: "Dr. Furlan studies the biology of blood stem cell transplantation and cellular immunotherapy for people with cancers and other diseases. He is learning how immune cells, such as T cells, behave during and after treatment, and how changes in immune cell behavior affect treatment outcomes. He aims to use what he learns to improve transplantation and T-cell therapies for children. Dr. Furlan employs a method called single-cell genomics, which reveals an unprecedented level of detail about the individual cells in a sample. This technique shows him how immune cells respond to new biological surroundings, or microenvironments, throughout treatment. One particular research focus is immune dysfunction in graft-vs.-host disease, in which transplanted donor immune cells attack a patientâ€™s healthy tissues. He also focuses on learning how to improve T-cell therapy and how transplanted donor immune cells affect cancers. https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/furlan-scott.html and https://mcb-seattle.edu/faculty-profile/?uid=362."
