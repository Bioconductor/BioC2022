text: "Jalees Rehman is a professor of Medicine, Pharmacology and Biomedical Engineering at University of Illinois, College of Medicine. His laboratory investigates inflammation and immune responses to pathogens as well as the resolution of tissue injury using mechanistic molecular approaches, experimental disease models and novel computational approaches. One example is the development of a machine learning approach to infer the activity of transcription factors using single cell RNA-seq data and prior knowledge gleaned from ChIP-seq data. Understanding the dynamics of physiological and pathophysiological gene expression networks can help distinguish adaptive (“healthy”) and maladaptive (“unhealthy” or “excessive”) responses to stressors. He is a Fellow of the American Heart Association, and an Elected Member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation. Jalees went to medical school at the Technische Universität München in Munich, Germany. He also completed clinical training as a cardiologist and postdoctoral training in vascular regeneration as part of a physician scientist track at Indiana University, School of Medicine. http://mcph.uic.edu/rehman/ and  https://twitter.com/jalees_rehman."
